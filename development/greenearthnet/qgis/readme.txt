the netCDF outputs from Contextformer are not automatically formatted correctly when imported into QGIS in that the timesteps are separated into bands rather than a time series in the ndvi group
to see the individual predictions for each timestep, you must specify the symbology to be a "singleband pseudocolor" and then select the specific band
