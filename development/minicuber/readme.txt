This directory is meant to document changes made to earthnet_minicuber which were necessary to adapt for use within NRCan
See setup.txt for the changes made

No script was made to generate batches of minicubes. Individual minicubes were replicated using the preexisting minicubes from the 
greenaerthnet data manually in the Jupyter notebooks found in 'notebooks'
